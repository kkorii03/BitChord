/**
 * A YouTube title, as a lyrics database would have indexed it.
 *
 * Every source here but [SimpMusicLyrics] is asked for a name, and the name
 * this app has is YouTube's, which is not the name anyone catalogued. "Dracula
 * (feat. JENNIE)" is filed by Apple, LRCLIB and everyone else as "Dracula", and
 * asked for verbatim it misses all of them — which is exactly how a track ends
 * up answered by whichever source happened to clean the title on its own
 * ([PaxSenix] was the only one that did) regardless of the order the user put
 * their sources in.
 *
 * ### What is taken off, and what is deliberately left on
 *
 * Only credits and packaging: who else is on the record, and how the upload was
 * labelled. Those are not part of the recording's name anywhere.
 *
 * Anything that names a *different recording* stays — "(Remix)", "(Acoustic)",
 * "(Live)", "(Remastered 2011)", "(Sped Up)". Those look like the same kind of
 * bracket and are the opposite: stripping them turns a search for one recording
 * into a search for another, and the lyrics that come back are confidently
 * wrong rather than merely missing. A miss is recoverable; the wrong words
 * scrolling in time with the right song is not.
